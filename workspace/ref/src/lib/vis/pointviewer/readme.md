this folder is just a testbed for the 
pointcloud viewer. i learn how to add
mesh and point cloud and text into a
scene in three js. more specifically, 
i add multiple scenes in a single canvas
in order to show more objects in a 
single html. 

```
.
|-- air_0001.xyz : generated from tmp.py
|-- des.txt : random text file for test
|-- helix_201.xzy : a point cloud with 201 points
|-- index.html : the testbed
|-- model.obj : the mesh file used for test
|-- script.js : functions for rendering
|-- style.css : useless
|-- tmp.py
|-- wegbl_loader_xyz.html : useless
|-- windmill.obj : useless
`-- XYZLoader.obj : helpful with writing 
        functions in script.js. overall,
        it is useless
```

this folder is just a testbed for renderer.
and it shows the steps to write a renderer.
it is important for writing scenes_generator.py
